# ebox

The `ebox` directory has to be placed in the `/home/` directory. Not all subdirectories are required for the Edrive to function correctly.

The `ebox` directory contains the following sub-directories:

sub-directory name | contents |
--- | ---
`RobotArm_student` | 
`other_svn` | 
`scripts2` | contains scripts for the grub configuration, eth renaming, removing files based on mac address and boot scripts to mount drive. The scripts are located under `/home/ebox/.scripts`.
`software` | contains lubuntu logo
`svn` | contains all files required for QADScope.
`version` | This directory is normally hidden `.version`. It contains a version file with modifications made.
