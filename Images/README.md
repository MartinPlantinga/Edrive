# Images

There are two images, the most recent one (`2017-02-03-13-img`) has been tested and works. The other image doesn't work with real experiments. File permissions are the problem and don't allow the corresponding executable to be compiled.

## How to use

1. Download the image
2. Merge the files in the directories named `merge*` according to the file named `filename.txt`.
3. It is important that the name of the merged file corresponds to the name in each `filename.txt` file.
4. The merged file has to be put in the `2017-02-03-13-img` directory and the `merge*` directories have to be deleted.
5. Use Clonezilla to unpack the image in a drive.
